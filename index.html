        <p>If we take 47, reverse and add, 47 + 74 = 121, which is palindromic.</p>
        <p>Not all numbers produce palindromes so quickly. For example:</p>
        <p><span class="terms">349 + 943 = 1292, 1292 + 2921 = 4213, 4213 + 3124 = 7337</span></p>
        <p>That is, 349 took three iterations to arrive at a palindrome.</p>
        <p>Although no one has proved it yet, it is thought that some numbers, like 196, never produce a palindrome. A
            number that never forms a palindrome through the reverse and add process is called a Lychrel number. Due to
            the theoretical nature of these numbers, and for the purpose of this problem, we shall assume that a number
            is Lychrel until proven otherwise. In addition you are given that for every number below ten-thousand, it
            will either (i) become a palindrome in less than fifty iterations, or (ii) no one, with all the computing
            power that exists, has managed so far to map it to a palindrome. In fact, 10677 is the first number to be
            shown to require over 50 iterations before producing a palindrome: 4668731596684224866951378644 (53
            iterations, 28 digits).</p>
        <p>Surprisingly, there are palindromic numbers that are themselves Lychrel numbers; the first example is 4994.
        </p>
        <p>How many Lychrel numbers are below the limit? Begin by entering a number.</p>
